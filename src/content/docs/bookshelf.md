Some books I finished (and therefore at least enjoyed). Highly recommended books come with a ⭐.

<div class="gallery">
  {bookData.map((book) => (
    <a href={book.url} class="card">
      <Image src={book.image} alt={book.title} width="200" class="book-cover" />
      <h3>
        {book.title}
        {book.starred && " ⭐"}
      </h3>
      <span class="font-bold text-sm pt-1" style="opacity: 0.5;">
        {book.fiction ? "Fiction" : "Nonfiction"}, by {book.author}
        {book.yearRead && `, I read ${book.yearRead}`}
      </span>
      {book.myNotes && (
        <p class="pt-4">
          <b>Notes:</b> {book.myNotes}
        </p>
      )}
    </a>
  ))}

Going back over my books I'm shocked at how little I remember of them, and some books have been left out of the bookshelf for this reason. Andy was right, [books don't work](https://andymatuschak.org/books/). However books are still a great escape from the high-stimulation world of computers, fiction is still very fun to read, and even non-fiction has its place: I'm thinking of nonfiction now less like "I want to learn about this" and more like "I like the idea that this book is about, and want a physical thing to remind me of that, and hopefully will get to talk to other people about this and thereby keep the idea alive".

:::note
Someone bumped the shelf! And knocked off all of the images and hyperlinks... maintenance is underway, we appreciate your patience.
