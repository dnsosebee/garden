### Notes
I got a one month ceramics membership with Leah. On a friend's recommendation we skipped the beginner class - in fact we skipped _all_ the classes and went straight to the free-form membership, which meant we could learn at our own pace and make whatever we wanted.

I learned a lot from [Florian Gadsby's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@floriangadsby). Ceramics is hard.
