## Data Collection

I like thinking about executive functioning, which is why I think so much about [human programming](https://www.humanprogramming.substack.com) and build things like [Methodable](https://a.methodable.com).

I plan to give myself goals and then attempt to document the entirety of my thought and executive-functioning processes as I attempt to compete the goals. In doing so I will learn more about how doing things actually works. I can use these learnings to later program AI agents that do good executive functioning.
