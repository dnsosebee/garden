Here's where I'm usually hanging these days.

## The main thing
I'm working on AI web apps through my LLC [Harmonic Software](https://harmonic.so/). My current work includes helping the Josh Bersin Company build the HR assistant [Galileo](https://sanalabs.com/galileo) and helping [Sana Labs](https://sana.ai/) design a natural-language to third-party actions system.

## Other things
- I climb regularly in locations around the bay area.
- I'm actively building this website and the [Harmonic Software](https://harmonic.so/) website.
- I journal every morning and maintain other routines for holistic reflection.
