## Vocations
I'm building AI and data-management systems through my LLC [Harmonic Software](https://harmonic.so/). My current work includes helping [Sana Labs](https://sana.ai/) design a transactional agent framework and helping the Josh Bersin Company build the HR assistant [Galileo](https://sanalabs.com/galileo).

## Research interests
I'm planning to rejuvenate my [human programming](/human-programming) projects for the AI age - could I design a reflexive and human-controllable language for directing complex AI behavior?

Accordingly I am learning about LLMs, AI alignment / interpretability, multi-agent programming systems and neurosymbolic programming.

## Other Foci
- Connecting with people
- Making use of Denver's nature - climbing, backpacking, running
- Writing, such as on this website and [Human Programming](https://humanprogramming.substack.com)
- Cultivating a positive attitude
