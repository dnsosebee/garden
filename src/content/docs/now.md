Here's where I'm usually hanging these days.

## Vocations
I'm building AI web apps through my LLC [Harmonic Software](https://harmonic.so/). My current work includes helping the Josh Bersin Company build the HR assistant [Galileo](https://sanalabs.com/galileo) and helping [Sana Labs](https://sana.ai/) design a natural-language to third-party actions system.

## Research interests
I'm planning to rejuvenate my [human programming](/human-programming) projects for the AI age - could I design a language for directing complex AI behavior?

Accordingly I am ambiently learning about LLMs, AI alignment / interpretability, multi-agent programming systems, behavioral science, and intelligence.

## Avocations
- I climb regularly in locations around the bay area.
- I'm actively building this website and the [Harmonic Software](https://harmonic.so/) website.
- I journal every morning and maintain other programatic reflection routines.
