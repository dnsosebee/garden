Below is my list of approved riddles. I have spent days, months, and even years solving some of them. Not all riddles are worth spending a year of your life on - only the good ones. What makes a riddle good?

In my mind a good riddle is well-defined: the problem should be clear, and more importantly the _space of possible solutions_ should be clear. Many riddles don't meet this test, for example the classic ["look in the mirror and see what you saw..."](https://riddlesbrainteasers.com/room-windows/) riddle. What a shame it would be to spend your time working on a riddle, only to later learn that there's no good answer!

Of course you can't tell if a riddle is good (and therefore whether it's worth your time) unless you can trust the person giving you the riddle. Most of these riddles have come to me from a variety of trustworthy people - my sister, my grandfather, my friend Karen, and above all my friends Aharon and [Dorit Hochbaum](https://hochbaum.ieor.berkeley.edu/).

For that reason I'm not a very big fan of sharing riddles on the internet. Riddles are only really fun if you have a trusted source to consult. Someone who you can run your ideas by; someone who can say "you're on the right track, and yes the answer really does exist, and yes it's within your reach".

And yet, I'd like to share my riddles on the internet! So here's the plan: I'll share these riddles here, but don't do them alone! Please reach out to let me know if you're working on one - I'd be happy to discuss it with you.

Lastly, you'll notice that I don't list answers. I would hate for you to look at the answer without solving the riddle first. There are only so many good riddles in the universe, and for each riddle you only get one shot; [then the egg is broken forever](/riddles/egg-drop).

## Approved riddles by difficulty

:::note
All the riddles are decently hard, but still it seems worthwhile to organize by difficulty, though it's highly subjective. So I have chosen a scale of "spiciness". This is a bit like one of those restaurants where the waiter will ask "Are you sure you want that? It's Thai spicy, not American spicy."
