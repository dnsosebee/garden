Three friend check into a hotel. The room costs $30, so they each pay $10. Later, the manager realizes that he's overcharged, and the room is actually $25, not $30. He send the bellboy up with $5 to return to the friends. The bellboy decides to give one dollar to each of the friends, and keeps two for himself. Now each friend has paid $9 total, for a sum of $27 for the three friends. Add the $2 that the bellboy pocketed, and we end up with $29 dollars accounted for. What happened to the thirtieth dollar?
