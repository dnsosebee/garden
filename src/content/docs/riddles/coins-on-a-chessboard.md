You and your friend have been imprisoned by an evil logician. The logician explains that tomorrow you will be put to trial...

> I'll bring you (without your friend) into a room where I have placed a chessboard. The chessboard has a coin on each of its 64 squares, each in a random orientation, either heads or tails. I will point out a particular square to you, unknown to your friend. Then you must flip exactly one coin, and no more.
>
> After your flip your coin and exit the room, your friend may enter, and upon seeing the chessboard they must be able to determine exactly which coin I pointed out (they do not need to know which coin was flipped).
>
> There will be no communication whatsoever between the two of you on the day of the trial. But today, you may strategize as much as you'd like.
>
> ... as per usual, correctly guessing the indicated coin is a matter of life or death!

**What strategy allows you to communicate the indicated square to your friend using only a single coin flip?**

## Daniel's Notes

A really excellent one, and another one that took me a very long time (years?) to solve.

Please assume that the orientation of the board itself is clear to both you and your friend upon entering.
