You have been imprisoned in a room with two indistinguishable doors. One of the doors leads to your freedom, and the other to certain death.

With you are two guards, and both guards know which door leads to freedom. However, one of the guards will always lie to you, and the other always tell the truth. The guards, like the doors, are indistinguishable.

You are granted the ability to ask a single yes-or-no question to one of the guards. **What yes-or-no question could you ask a single guard to determine which door leads to freedom?**

## Daniel's Notes

A classic!
