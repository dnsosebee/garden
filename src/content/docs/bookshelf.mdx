import { Image } from "astro:assets";
import { bookData } from "../data/books.ts";

These are books I finished (and therefore at least enjoyed). Highly recommended books come with a ⭐.

<div class="gallery small-gallery">
  {bookData.map((book) => (
    <a href={book.url} class="card">
      <Image src={book.image} alt={book.title} width="200" class="book-cover" />
      <h3>
        {book.starred && "⭐ "}
        {book.title}
      </h3>
      <span class="font-bold text-sm" style="opacity: 0.5;">
        {book.fiction ? "Fiction" : "Nonfiction"}, by {book.author}
        {book.yearRead && `, I read ${book.yearRead}`}
      </span>
      {book.myNotes && (
        <p>
          <b>Notes:</b> {book.myNotes}
        </p>
      )}
    </a>
  ))}
</div>
