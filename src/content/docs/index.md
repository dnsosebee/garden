I like to create and express complex and beautiful patterns.

### Programming & logic

- [Human Programming](/human-programming) - I develop tools for specifying and executing "human programs" - formally-defined human workflows or multi-agent workflows.
- [Daniel's Approved Riddles](/riddles) - Top tier math and logic riddles.

### Music & art

- [Music Gallery](/music) - my piano and electronic music recordings.
- [Visual Art Gallery](/art) - my drawings and paintings. I like optical illusions and pattern-heavy drawing.

## About this website

Here is [this site's source code](https://github.com/dnsosebee/garden). All content is written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) (including the [visual art gallery](/art)!) and published as static HTML pages using [Astro](https://astro.build/). The sidebar and site styles are thanks to the [Starlight documentation theme](https://starlight.astro.build/).

_planned additions:_
- Sneaky Town
- My journaling system
- Bookshelf / blogshelf
