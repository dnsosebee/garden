I recently moved to Denver for the summer, into a furnished apartment with my friends Lukas and Samantha. I felt compelled to create an inventory of the items I decided to bring.

If you are on desktop you can see an outline on the right side of the screen, and on mobile you can click "On this page" to view the outline. Each category below has a picture and commentary on the items contained, and at the end I include some closing thoughts on the accumulation of stuff.

## Adventure/Exercise
### Backpacking
![Knolled layout of my backpacking gear](/assets/eyc-2024/backpacking.jpg)

My backpack is pretty banged up, missing a chest strap and torn at the seams. The boots are starting to tear too. Most of the items here have persisted over many trips and years, the sun hat being a notable new entrant, kindly given to me last week by my mother. She also taught me to sew so that I could fix the holes that New Zealand mice chewed through my solo MSR tent (top right) to get at an [apricot chocolate Bumper Bar](https://kiwicornerdairy.com/products/bumper-bar-apricot-chocolate-75g).

The Camelbak was found on the side of the road and has never had a bite valve. The plastic bowl beneath the pot is for coffee and "tea" (pasta water). The metal espresso cups are for coffee during "ultraheavy" backpacking trips. The blue playing cards come on every trip and usually go unused, but they remain part of the kit. Off-camera items include [a moka pot or AeroPress](#coffee) for coffee, a [journal](#journal), and a [book](#books). 

### Bouldering & Climbing
![Knolled layout of my climbing gear](/assets/eyc-2024/climbing.jpg)

Olly and I co-purchased the big green crashpad in Las Vegas for climbing in Red Rock Canyon ([here's the pad in full 360° action](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105085399966233543991/photos/@36.1616633,-115.4107698,3a,90y,235.18h,89.09t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sAF1QipPlh_qnaULS3VYQ_9dK2-ROtGJq6GKrGuVM6y_K!2e10!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPlh_qnaULS3VYQ_9dK2-ROtGJq6GKrGuVM6y_K%3Dw900-h600-k-no-pi0.9103281259427121-ya17.181177733272847-ro0-fo90!7i11264!8i5632!4m3!8m2!3m1!1e1?coh=205410&entry=ttu)), and I purchased his half of the pad at auction after the trip. I bought the hangboard to rehab a pulley injury developed on that same trip - no surprise since I went from three years of climbing-free Ultimate Frisbee to bouldering every day for a month.

Of course, the climbing gear goes great with the backpacking gear for backcountry bouldering trips like [my trip with Lukas and Dan to Middle St. Vrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2NIuGs7Oz0), which Lukas and I hope to revisit this August.

### Running
![Knolled layout of my running gear](/assets/eyc-2024/running.jpg)

The "THANK YOU" bag is just for organizing the normal run items: shades from the great [Boulder Sports Recycler](https://www.bouldersportsrecycler.com/), sunscreen, handheld bottle, and earbuds.

## Productivity
### Stationary office
<div style="background:black">

</div>

These are the things I use to think and write and code. The whiteboard, from the streets in San Francisco, is currently ziptied to an extendable TV mount to my left for ergonomic whiteboarding. I like to draw by hand when working on life or software design, like [this diagram here](/#programming--logic). The drawing pad is occasionally used for work notes, and occasionally for [art](/art).

The all-black journal is in fact a pink journal which has been removed and placed in [a more appropriate section of this (digital) journal entry](#journal), but whose distinction remains.

### Travel office
![Knolled layout of my travel office gear](/assets/eyc-2024/travel-office.jpg)

The iPad, keyboard, and trackpad (plus the Roost laptop stand from the previous image) form a portable dual-monitor setup. I haven't used this setup enough to justify the price and I don't feel much affection for these items. However, I hope the iPad will allow me to draw more conceptual diagrams for blog posts [a la Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/drawinginvisibles1).

I have much more affection for the headphones which I've had since 2019, and for the "omnicharger" adorned with my friend Nick's [ArchiveBox](https://github.com/ArchiveBox) logo.

## Daily Rituals
### Journal
![My journal](/assets/eyc-2024/journal.png)

Each time I buy a journal I get a different color. This time I chose fuchsia based on a now defunct bracelet-based behavioral-nudging system I created in which fuchsia and lime green represented _reflection_ and _execution_ respectively, as a nod to the colors on [the cover of the book I Am a Strange Loop](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Nfh4u+rKL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg) and the ideas within, which I found to be highly analogical to [my loopy journalling systems](/origins-of-life).

These days I am writing down my dreams every morning for lucid dreaming purposes, and journalling in the backyard as I drink my...

### Coffee
![My coffee](/assets/eyc-2024/coffee.jpg)

Sometimes I consider quitting coffee to save money, but the social aspects keep me loyal. Also, now that I've categorized coffee as a "daily ritual" here, I feel even more positivity towards the substance.

The moka pot has gone on a fair number of backpacking trips and the AeroPress is starting to make its debut as a lighter and smaller alternative - thanks again to my parents for that one, I truly left home with an armful of gifts this time.

## Reading
![My books in Denver](/assets/eyc-2024/books.jpg)

I am currently in the middle of _UNSONG_, _The Dream Machine_, _The Art of Doing Science and Engineering_, _The Art of Gig_, _Getting to Yes_, _How to Win Friends and Influence People_, _Existential Kink_, and _Laws of Form_. I am doing a book club on _Laws of Form_ with some friendly people I met at [Edge Esmeralda](https://www.edgeesmeralda.com/). It's telling that nearly all of my in-progress books are non-fiction, as apparently I enjoy only fiction books enough to finish them. 

_The Wondering Jew_ was given to me by my sister and I am excited to get started with it. _God is a Verb_ was picked up at a thrift store in Oakland, and features a review from Jack Kornfeld whom I know from Sam Harris's Waking Up meditation app, so this also shows promise as a Jewish book which may match my current interests, as does _Mastering Life_, which besides the eye-rolly title seems to document an interesting Jewish life full of adventures, which I told Olly sounded sorta similar to [his](https://bigdumbadventure.substack.com/about) (The first line of Olly's "about" page says "This is a daily blog involving the adventures of a 26 year old nerdy Jew on an honest quest around the world to find purpose").

About half of these books are borrowed from my family, the other half I purchased - I've taken recently to purchasing books even when I don't have capacity to read them.

## Piano
![My piano setup](/assets/eyc-2024/piano.jpg)

I've had a number of digital keyboards and none of them really stuck, so I shelled out for this Yamaha P125 with 88 weighted keys. It's still not the same as a real piano but it's good enough for me to enjoy and to keep up [my music](/music).

## Other Social Activities
![Knolled layout of social items](/assets/eyc-2024/social-activities.jpg)

The frisbee, hammock, hacky sack and speaker form a nice unit for outdoor socializing. On the left, my board game [Sneaky Town](/sneaky-town).

## Clothing

### Casual
![My casual clothing](/assets/eyc-2024/casual-clothes.jpg)

Olly gave me the Maison MIHARA YASUHIRO shoes on the right as a birthday present to replace my "Mardi Gras shoes" on the left, on recommendation of his friend who is a stylist for NBA players. Karen knitted the pair of socks to the left of the shoes.

Note: many outer layers and athletic clothes were left out of this section and included in the [activity](#backpacking)-[specific](#climbing) [sections](#running) above.

### Dress
![My dress clothing](/assets/eyc-2024/dress-clothes.jpg)

My sister made me the fractal kippah, which I hold near and dear.

## Bags

![My baggage](/assets/eyc-2024/baggage.jpg)

Something for a trip of every duration. The blue High Sierra has been my daily driver since at least high school.

## Memerobilia

[Here's a 360° photo from a nearby mountain](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105085399966233543991/photos/@-0.5888707,-78.5080671,3a,75y,146.42h,86.84t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sAF1QipMlL5ox0TZQ57BLzDp6GnJpZeywnmHdtzpzNUaD!2e10!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipMlL5ox0TZQ57BLzDp6GnJpZeywnmHdtzpzNUaD%3Dw900-h600-k-no-pi3.1632942921139744-ya0.4165223873125683-ro0-fo90!7i8704!8i4352!4m3!8m2!3m1!1e1?coh=205410&entry=ttu) where you can see the top half of his torso.

## Other Necessities, for Completeness

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-end;">

![My toiletries](/assets/eyc-2024/toiletries.jpg)

![My allergy gear](/assets/eyc-2024/allergies.jpg)

![My bedside table gear](/assets/eyc-2024/bedside.jpg)

![My monkey hamper](/assets/eyc-2024/hamper.jpg)

</div>



I also have...

1. Toiletries
2. Allergy gear
3. Bedside electronics
4. Hamper

The toiletries and bedside electronics could each make a case for being included in the [daily rituals section](#daily-rituals), but neither is pleasing enough to merit special treatment.

The air purifier was rescued from a past coliving house in Menlo Park and the hamper cost an extra 5 cents for the monkey.

## Thoughts

(Not pictured)

Well, I certainly have enough stuff.

I went into this exercise hoping I would learn something about myself, but I hadn't anticipated the crisp overview of my interests that would emerge and am delighted about that. Notably absent are cooking things, which I enjoy but have left in the Bay Area.

I do think I succeed at accumulating mostly things that spark joy, buying used or free items when possible, and wearing them out once bought. But in fairness I also have many left-behind possessions (not pictured) that I no longer use and probably never will.

I have spoken with my brother-in-law Netzach about how to harmoniously deal with old and unwanted things, and we agreed that there is no good way to do so and that the best approach is to not accumulate in the first place. Of course, this is often in tension with my value to explore. At least after doing this exercise I have a record of how that tension has played out in my recent life.

 <!-- (and I am a strong skeptic of any "sustainable" branded products). Easier said than done. The house I just moved into is full of past residents' stuff, long forgotten. It will eventually be someone's problem (or opportunity), and already it is a little bit mine.

The value "don't accumulate in the first place" (an aspect of "be frugal") -->
