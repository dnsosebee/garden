I recently moved to Denver for the summer, into a mostly furnished apartment with my friends Lukas and Samantha. I took a carload of stuff, and thought it would be fun to catalog those belongings, as they are truly my ["every-year carry"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyday_carry) - the items that I take with me when I change homes, at least for the time being.

Below you will find all of those items with commentary. There's also an outline to the right if you're on desktop.

Among all of the exercises I have undertaken to better understand myself, this one has been surprisingly effective. The outline that emerged is especially interesting to me, as it represents a particularly clarifying decomposition of my current activities.

## Adventure/Exercise
### Backpacking
![Knolled layout of my backpacking gear](/assets/eyc-2024/backpacking.jpg)

My backpack is pretty banged up at this point, missing a chest strap and torn at the seams. The boots are starting to tear too. Most of the items here have persisted over many trips and years, the sun hat being a notable new entrant, kindly given to me last week by my mother. She also taught me to sew so that I could fix the holes that New Zealand mice chewed through the solo MSR tent (top right) to get at an [apricot chocolate Bumper Bar](https://kiwicornerdairy.com/products/bumper-bar-apricot-chocolate-75g).

The Camelbak was found on the side of the road and has never had a bite valve. The plastic bowl beneath the pot is for coffee and "tea" (pasta water). The metal espresso cups are for coffee during "ultraheavy" backpacking trips. The blue playing cards come on every trip and usually go unused, but they remain part of the kit. Off-camera items include [a moka pot or AeroPress](#coffee) for coffee, a [journal](#journal), and a [book](#books). 

### Bouldering & Climbing
![Knolled layout of my climbing gear](/assets/eyc-2024/climbing.jpg)

Olly and I co-purchased the big green crashpad in Las Vegas for climbing in Red Rock Canyon ([here's the pad in full 360° action](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105085399966233543991/photos/@36.1616633,-115.4107698,3a,90y,235.18h,89.09t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sAF1QipPlh_qnaULS3VYQ_9dK2-ROtGJq6GKrGuVM6y_K!2e10!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPlh_qnaULS3VYQ_9dK2-ROtGJq6GKrGuVM6y_K%3Dw900-h600-k-no-pi0.9103281259427121-ya17.181177733272847-ro0-fo90!7i11264!8i5632!4m3!8m2!3m1!1e1?coh=205410&entry=ttu)), and I purchased his half of the pad at auction after the trip. I bought the hangboard to rehab a pulley injury developed on that same trip - no surprise since I went from three years of climbing-free Ultimate Frisbee to bouldering every day for a month.

Of course, the climbing gear goes great with the backpacking gear for backcountry bouldering trips like [my trip with Lukas and Dan to Middle St. Vrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2NIuGs7Oz0), which Lukas and I hope to revisit this August.

### Running
![Knolled layout of my running gear](/assets/eyc-2024/running.jpg)

The "THANK YOU" bag is just for organizing the normal run items: shades from the great [Boulder Sports Recycler](https://www.bouldersportsrecycler.com/), sunscreen, handheld bottle, and earbuds, though I try to run without music every now and then.

## Productivity
### Stationary office
![Knolled layout of my office gear](/assets/eyc-2024/office.png)

These are the things I use to think and write and code. The whiteboard, from the streets in San Francisco, is currently ziptied to an extendable TV mount to my left for ergonomic whiteboarding. I like to draw by hand when working on life or code problems, like [this diagram here](/#programming--logic), and while the paper drawing pad is sometimes used for work notes, it can be used for [art](/art) too.

The all-black journal is in fact a pink journal which has been removed due to miscategorization and placed in [a later section of this (digital) journal entry](#journal), but whose distinction remains.

### Travel office
![Knolled layout of my travel office gear](/assets/eyc-2024/travel-office.jpg)

The iPad, keyboard, and trackpad plus the Roost laptop stand from the previous image form a portable dual-monitor setup. I haven't used this setup enough to justify the price and I don't feel the same affection for it as I do for my other belongings. However, I hope the iPad will allow me to draw more conceptual diagrams for blog posts [a la Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/drawinginvisibles1).

I have much more affection for the headphones which I've had since 2019, and for the omnicharger adorned with my friend Nick's [ArchiveBox](https://github.com/ArchiveBox) logo.

## Daily Rituals
### Journal
![My journal](/assets/eyc-2024/journal.png)

Each time I buy a journal I get a different color. This time I chose fuchsia based on a now defunct bracelet-based behavioral-nudging system I created in which fuchsia and lime green represented _reflection_ and _execution_ respectively, as a nod to the colors on [the cover of the book I Am a Strange Loop](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Nfh4u+rKL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg) and to the ideas within, which I found to be highly analogical to [my loopy journalling systems](/life).

These days I am writing down my dreams every morning for lucid dreaming purposes, and journalling in the backyard as I drink my...

### Coffee
![My coffee](/assets/eyc-2024/coffee.jpg)

Sometimes I consider quitting coffee to save money, but the social aspects keep me loyal. The fact that I categorized coffee as a "daily ritual" here shifted my perspective positively as well.

The moka pot has gone on a fair number of backpacking trips and the AeroPress is starting to make its debut as a lighter and smaller alternative - thanks again to my parents for that one, I truly left home with an armful of gifts this time.

## Reading
![My books in Denver](/assets/eyc-2024/books.jpg)

I am currently in the middle of _UNSONG_, _The Dream Machine_, _The Art of Doing Science and Engineering_, _The Art of Gig_, _Getting to Yes_, _How to Win Friends and Influence People_, _Existential Kink_, and _Laws of Form_. I am doing a book club on _Laws of Form_ with some friendly people I met at [Edge Esmeralda](https://www.edgeesmeralda.com/). It's telling that all of my in-progress books are non-fiction, as apparently I enjoy only fiction books enough to actually finish them. 

_The Wondering Jew_ was given to me by my sister and I am excited to get started with it. _God is a Verb_ was picked up at a thrift store in Oakland, and features a review from Jack Kornfeld whom I know from Sam Harris's Waking Up meditation app, so this also shows promise as a Jewish book which may match my current interests, as does _Mastering Life_, which besides the eye-rolly title seems to document an interesting Jewish life full of adventures, which I told Olly sounded sorta similar to [his](https://bigdumbadventure.substack.com/about) (The first line of Olly's "about" page says "This is a daily blog involving the adventures of a 26 year old nerdy Jew on an honest quest around the world to find purpose").

About half of these books are borrowed from my family, the other half I purchased - I've taken recently to purchasing books even when I don't have capacity to read them immediately. I'm alright with that since they're nice to have around.

## Piano
![My piano setup](/assets/eyc-2024/piano.jpg)

I've had a number of digital keyboards and none of them really stuck, so I shelled out for this Yamaha P125 with 88 weighted keys. It's still not the same as a real piano but it's good enough for me to enjoy and to keep up [my music writing and improvisation](/music).

## Other Social Activities
![Knolled layout of social items](/assets/eyc-2024/social-activities.jpg)

The frisbee, hammock, hacky sack and speaker form a nice unit for outdoor socializing. My board game [Sneaky Town](/sneaky-town) is on the left.

## Clothing

### Casual
![My casual clothing](/assets/eyc-2024/casual-clothes.jpg)

Olly gave me the Maison MIHARA YASUHIRO shoes on the right as a birthday present to replace my "Mardi Gras shoes" on the left, on recommendation of his friend who is a stylist for NBA players. Karen knitted the pair of socks to the left of the shoes.

Many of my outer layers and athletic clothes were left out of this section and included in [activity](#backpacking)-[specific](#climbing) [sections](#running) instead.

### Dress
![My dress clothing](/assets/eyc-2024/dress-clothes.jpg)

My sister made me the fractal kippah, which is very important to me.

## Bags

![My baggage](/assets/eyc-2024/baggage.jpg)

Something for a trip of every duration. The blue High Sierra has been my daily driver since at least high school.

## Memerobilia
![My memerobilia](/assets/eyc-2024/memerobilia.jpg)

Above, a paper airplane made by my nephew Betzalel, and below, a picture of my and my brother's tent in front of Cotopaxi. [Here's a 360° photo from a nearby mountain](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105085399966233543991/photos/@-0.5888707,-78.5080671,3a,75y,146.42h,86.84t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sAF1QipMlL5ox0TZQ57BLzDp6GnJpZeywnmHdtzpzNUaD!2e10!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipMlL5ox0TZQ57BLzDp6GnJpZeywnmHdtzpzNUaD%3Dw900-h600-k-no-pi3.1632942921139744-ya0.4165223873125683-ro0-fo90!7i8704!8i4352!4m3!8m2!3m1!1e1?coh=205410&entry=ttu) where you can see the top half of his torso.

## Other Necessities, for Completeness

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-end;">

![My toiletries](/assets/eyc-2024/toiletries.jpg)

![My allergy gear](/assets/eyc-2024/allergies.jpg)

![My bedside table gear](/assets/eyc-2024/bedside.jpg)

![My monkey hamper](/assets/eyc-2024/hamper.jpg)

</div>



I also have...

1. Toiletries
2. Allergy gear
3. Bedside electronics
4. Hamper

The toiletries and bedside electronics could each make a case for being included in the [daily rituals section](#daily-rituals), but neither is pleasing enough to merit special treatment.

The air purifier was rescued from a past coliving house in Menlo Park and the hamper cost an extra 85 cents for the monkey.

## Thoughts

(Not pictured)

Well, I certainly have enough stuff.

Notably absent are cooking things, which I enjoy but have left in the Bay Area.

I do think I succeed at accumulating mostly things that spark joy, buying used or free items when possible, and wearing them out once bought. But in fairness I have a lot of additional possessions (not pictured) that I no longer use and probably never will.

I have spoken with my brother-in-law Netzach about how to harmoniously deal with old and unwanted things, and we agreed that there is no good way to do so and that the best approach is to not accumulate in the first place. Easier said than done, but "don't accumulate in the first place" is a value I take seriously, and it is in direct tension with my value to explore.


 <!-- (and I am a strong skeptic of any "sustainable" branded products). Easier said than done. The house I just moved into is full of past residents' stuff, long forgotten. It will eventually be someone's problem (or opportunity), and already it is a little bit mine.

The value "don't accumulate in the first place" (an aspect of "be frugal") -->
